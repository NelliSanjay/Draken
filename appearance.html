    <ul>
        <li>Draken is a muscular teenager who is exceptionally tall for his age. His head is shaven on the sides and back to expose his signature dragon tattoo on his left temple.</li>
        <li>His blonde hair is long on the top of his head and kept in a neat braid. He leaves a few strands of hair loose in the front.</li>
        <li>He is confirmed to be quite lean and has chiseled abdominal muscles. Takemichi remarked that his body does not seem like that of a teenager.</li>
        <li>Draken has a scar on the left side of his abdomen after being stabbed. He wears the standard Toman Toppoku while with the gang, and his favorite casual outfit seems to be a patterned long jacket.</li>
    </ul>
